# Solutions for HackerRank's 30 days of code tutorial

_Page on HackerRank: [30 days of code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)_

This repository is meant to be a personal log. However, you may choose to look into my solutions to the problems in case you are stuck. Just some caveats:
- Make sure that you have tried your bloody best to solve the questions on your own. Even some hair pulling or a tear, now and then, shouldn't hurt.
- Make sure you have gone through the _discussions_ section for the problem.
